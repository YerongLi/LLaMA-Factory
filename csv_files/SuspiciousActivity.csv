One of their names was [PERSON] (can't remember the other girl's name). They looked like they were in their ##'s maybe?? Well i took the survey and the questions were about abortion, alcohol, [PERSON], etc. And at the end they asked me if i wanted more information about it. I said yes, so they asked if they could get my phone number so i was like “yes of course”. So i gave one of them my number and they said they would text me but they haven't yet. Anyways, after the whole situation i realized how this has been happening a lot around [GPE] and how they use this tactic for human trafficking. So I'm super terrified now and i feel like I'm gonna get kidnapped and i just don't even know how to walk outside without feeling like I'm being chased. So yes i hate everything

 User: A man named [PERSON] has been acting suspiciously via [ORG].

But recently he's been commenting on all the posts that have to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation on [DATE]. Anyone who posts asking for an extra ticket he responds with “yes,” but he is definitely not part of [ORG]Arts and I'm not sure he's even a [ORG] student. I'm a [ORG]Arts student, and I can confirm he's definitely not part of any of the departments. I've checked other posts about different graduations at [ORG] (biology, science, etc.) that are on [DATE] but he has commented on none of them, only [ORG]Arts and only responding with “yes” to people who ask if anyone has extra tickets. Based on his past interactions with people and his obsessive commenting on whenever anyone posts about the [ORG]Arts graduation, it has made me afraid he's planning on doing something potentially dangerous at the event. Graduation is on [DATE], and the ceremony begins at [QUANTITY]. I know it's a very vague tip but seeing him continue to comment and respond to everything that has to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation when he has nothing to do with [ORG]Arts and has been openly hostile online with [ORG]Arts students is making me really nervous.
