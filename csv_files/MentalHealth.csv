A user reaches out to an admin for advice on how to help a friend who recently opened up about attempting suicide. The user is concerned about the friend's mental health and wants to find a way to help without involving too many people. The admin suggests speaking to an officer or seeking help off campus, but the user is unsure if the friend will be willing to do so. The user also mentions that the friend has shown recent cuts on her arm and has a history of mental health issues in her family. The admin provides resources and offers to do a welfare check, but the user declines for now. The user is encouraged to continue talking to the friend and to reach out again if the situation worsens. The admin also offers support for the user.

 User: There is a man in the bottom floor of the [GPE] library that is crying, talking to himself, flailing his hands around and is just acting odd. He might be homeless because I have seen him sleep in the library at night before. He is in a red flannel, black workout pants and a blue hat. His actions are increasing in intensity as time goes on. He is currently laying on a green couch towards the back of the bottom floor of the library.
