The user is concerned about the friend's mental health and wants to find a way to help without involving too many people. The admin suggests speaking to an officer or seeking help off campus, but the user is unsure if the friend will be willing to do so. The user also mentions that the friend has shown recent cuts on her arm and has a history of mental health issues in her family.
