The user reported a traffic issue on John Smith Street in Raleigh, NC. The user was concerned that the lack of traffic signs was causing confusion for drivers and potentially leading to accidents. The user requested that the City of Raleigh be notified of the issue.


 
 User:  Is John Smith between Cary and Main still one-way? All of the one-way signs are down but traffic is still treating it as one-way and there are no traffic signs facing southbound traffic. Some cars exit the parking lot and turn the “wrong” way. Accident waiting to happen. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for using LiveSafe! John Smith is indeed still a one way street. Are all of the one way signs gone? If so, we can go ahead and let the City of Raleigh know to come replace them. 
 User: 
Yes. It is very hard to convince a driver they are going the wrong way when there are no signs to back you up? ��
Yes all the signs are gone. It’s been like that for a few weeks now.

The user is in a room with two roommates, John and Alex. The user believes that John and Alex have been smoking marijuana in their room, and the user is concerned about the possibility of them smoking in the room. The user does not believe that they need to speak with an officer unless it is absolutely necessary.


 
 User:  I am the girlfriend of John in room 304 in Building 12, and I am spending the night in the room. John and I have been in the room all day, and his roommate, Alex, came back into the room after going out with his girlfriend bringing with him a STRONG scent of weed (at 10am). As soon as they entered, the room was FILLED with the strong scent. They also went out earlier to smoke, (around 4pm) and had an out loud discussion about making plans to do so for the whole room to hear. They went to their friend “Brandon,” who I believe may be one of their dealers. There is no doubt in my mind that if one was to open the door to the room, someone could smell it immediately upon entering. 
 Dispatcher:  Do they have drugs in the room, or have they done drugs in the room? Are they there now? Do you wish to speak with an officer? 
 User: 
They do not have drugs in the room, however they do speak about smoking in their car often. They have not done drugs in the room (that I have knowledge of). Yes, they are in the room now. No I don’t think I need to talk to an officer unless its absolutely necessary. If it comes down to confrontation, I prefer not to have my name mentioned.
They have done drugs in the room, yes. They are not there now. I do not wish to speak with an officer unless it is absolutely necessary. I just want to report this so that someone can check on the room and make sure everything is okay.ss a great way to stay organized and focused, but it can also be a great way to get distracted and lose track of what's important. Here are some tips for using a planner effectively:

The user reported a suspicious person to the dispatcher. The user provided a detailed description of the person, including his physical appearance (5'4" tall, 121 lbs, brown hair), clothing (black pullover sweater, gray pants, black and gray backpack), and behavior (pacing around, talking to himself). The user also reported that the person may have been special needs.


 
 User:  There was someone pacing around and talking to himself in the lobby of [WEBSITE], in front of the big globe at around 3:45 pm [DATE]. He was a [NORP] male with short black hair. He was wearing a black pullover sweater, unsure of the color of the shirt under the pullover though it may have been white, long gray pants, and I am unsure of what type of shoes he was wearing. He did not have anything in his ears, which is why I'm sure he was talking to himself. I could not make out most of what he was saying except “Of course that wouldn't work, you idiot!” He also had a black and gray backpack which appeared to have things in it, unsure of what nature. It's possible he might have been special needs, but I am unsure because I did not approach him. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for the information, we will send an Officer to the building. 
 Dispatcher:  So is he still in the building 
 User: 
I[ORG] not sure. I was entering class at the time.
I don't think so, I saw him leave the lobby about 5 minutes ago.

The user reported a large amount of glass in the parking lot of the community health building. The dispatcher asked for more information about the glass, and the user confirmed that it was spread out throughout the parking lot and not just around a single car. The dispatcher assured the user that they had notified the proper party and thanked them for their report.


 
 User:  There is a large quantity of glass in the parking lot at the community health building (nursing and speech building) off of Park Avenue and [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]. 
 Dispatcher:  Hey there, [John Smith]. Is the glass that you've spotted around a parked vehicle by chance? Or is there just a general amount of glass throughout? 
 User:  It was in a few spots in the front visitor spots there were a few cars around. I know elderly people come there for hearing aids and didn’t want them to not see it and drive through it. It really looks like someone busted someone’s window but I have no evidence to support that it’s just a ton of glass spread out 
 Dispatcher:  All right. We're going to send an Officer that way to check the area to make sure that there wasn't a break-in or anything of the sort. Also, if nothing illegal is found, we'll notify [Facilities Management] to get the clean up process started.
