One of their names was [PERSON] (can't remember the other girl's name). They looked like they were in their ##'s maybe??

A user reports to an admin that a man named [PERSON] has been acting suspiciously on [ORG] by commenting on posts about the [ORG]Arts graduation on [DATE]. The user, who is a [ORG]Arts student, is concerned that the man may be planning something dangerous at the event. The admin thanks the user for the information and offers to pass it on to an officer. The user offers to send screenshots and the admin agrees to forward them to the investigating officer. The user asks if they should submit another anonymous tip and the admin says that would be fine. The admin also provides contact information for future assistance. 
 User: A man named [PERSON] has been acting suspiciously via [ORG]. I have been noticing his activity for a while now, and most of it seems to be harmless trolling and/or picking fights with people online, usually things that have to do with his far-right views. But recently he's been commenting on all the posts that have to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation on [DATE]. Anyone who posts asking for an extra ticket he responds with “yes,” but he is definitely not part of [ORG]Arts and I'm not sure he's even a [ORG] student. I'm a [ORG]Arts student, and I can confirm he's definitely not part of any of the departments. I've checked other posts about different graduations at [ORG] (biology, science, etc.) that are on [DATE] but he has commented on none of them, only [ORG]Arts and only responding with “yes” to people who ask if anyone has extra tickets. Based on his past interactions with people and his obsessive commenting on whenever anyone posts about the [ORG]Arts graduation, it has made me afraid he's planning on doing something potentially dangerous at the event. Graduation is on [DATE], and the ceremony begins at [QUANTITY]. I know it's a very vague tip but seeing him continue to comment and respond to everything that has to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation when he has nothing to do with [ORG]Arts and has been openly hostile online with [ORG]Arts students is making me really nervous. I hope that nothing is going on and he's just trolling but I felt like I needed to report it for my peace of mind just in case. Link to [ORG] profile: [WEBSITE]
Dispatcher: Thank you for providing this information. We will pass this information on to an officer. Would you like to be contacted by an officer? 
 User: That probably isn't necessary, that's really all the information I know. But I can also send screenshots if they're needed, I forgot to attach them beforehand.
Dispatcher: You can send the screenshots you have and I will forward them to the investigating officer. 
 User: Thank you! Should I do that through submitting another anonymous tip?
Dispatcher: That would be fine if you can't attach it through response here. 
 User: Ok it seems like I can't do it through response here so I'll do that! Thank you so much for your help.

Two older men in a courtyard in [LOCATION] were seen following people through gates and into common spaces of [ORGANIZATION]. One of the men had a large bag and both were wearing dark athletic clothing. They did not seem to be affiliated with [ORGANIZATION]. The user reported this to an admin, who sent officers to the scene and asked for a description of the men. The user described them as white, average height, and not speaking [LANGUAGE] well. The last place they were seen was in a common space by the stairs leading to the basement. The user clarified that there was no specific entry way. The admin thanked the user and asked if they would like to speak to the officers. The user declined and said they were in the courtyard. The admin arranged for an officer to meet the user near their entry way and asked for their name. The user confirmed their location and the admin said an officer was on their way. The user thanked the admin for their quick response and the admin thanked the user for the tip.
