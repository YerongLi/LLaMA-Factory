 User:  Group of males just attempted to steal a bike from John Smith. Headed towards convocation on foot, 123 Main St. At least one Asian, one very very African American individual in a hoodie. They spoke loudly about finding one without a bike lock, trying to pick them up and pull them off. Obviously attempted theft 
 Dispatcher:  Ok, I will let officers know right away. 
 User: 
['output']: I hope they all get busted majorly., ['response']: Yeah, I appreciate that. But I have to say, I'm really frustrated with the police department. I've had my bike stolen twice now and they never do anything about it.
