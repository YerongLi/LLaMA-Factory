The user reported that they were approached by college-aged men while on their way to class, and that the men gave different excuses to stop them and then tried to suggest they go somewhere private or “hang out” or give them their number. The user felt uncomfortable and unsafe, and reported the incidents to University Police. The user was asked to meet with University Police officers to discuss the incidents, and agreed to meet at the Student Union Building.


 
 User:  Hi, I am reporting this because it has happened 3 times within the past month. I am not sure if the incidents are related but they seem highly suspicious. 3 times I have been approached by college-aged men while on my way to class, all 3 times in the same place (outside of Leavy Library near the bushes as you turn to walk towards the village). They have all used different excuses to stop me, then pretending to be hitting on me. What was weird was that they tried to suggest we go somewhere private or “hang out” or give me their number. They were all different people but the excuses they gave were quite similar and since they were all in the same place I thought they may be related. Again, I'm not sure. I just wanted to make sure this stops happening because it seems like more than the guys trying to hit on girls. They seem to be trying to trick people into doing something. I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for contacting University Police, is the person who just approached you still there and are you able to tell me what he looks like and a clothing description. 
 User:  The third man from today was not still there when I walked back from the village, he was white with light hair and his clothes must have been average, I can’t remember what he was wearing. Sorry that’s not very helpful 
 Dispatcher:  Are you available to meet with University Police officers to discuss this issue? 
 User:  Sure, where should I go 
 Dispatcher:  Great, if you can wait in front of the Student Union Building by the large fountain I can have officers meet with you there. 
 User: 
Okay, thank you for your help.

It is not as loud but I am still concerned about him. He is growling and using profanity in just about every sentence. He does not even take a breath when he talks and has been doing it for # hours straight. The only thing I can compare it to is someone being possessed. He started again right after the officers left. The [ORG] said they got it handled but he obviously lied to them. He also has access to our hall which and has stayed up here for an hour for no reason

The user was walking between The Hue and Johnson halls when a man approached them and asked for money. The user was not carrying cash and told the man that they had class in about ten minutes and that they had to get there. The man continued to follow the user and try to reach out towards them, even after the user explained that they were broke too. The user felt like if they did not get emotional, the man would have kept badgering them and try to take their arm. The user is now buying mace to keep on them just in case.


 
 User:  Between The Hue and Johnson halls I was walking to class this morning around 10:30am and a man was asking me for money. I don't carry cash on me and I let him know that, but he kept following me and was begging me to use the ATM up the street at the gas station. I told him that I had class in about ten minutes and that I had to get there. I was continuously walking during this whole ordeal. When I told him this, he started reaching out to me and I backed away whenever he tried. He kept saying “I'm not preventing you from getting to class, I just need a few bucks,” all while trying to reach out towards me. When I got near Smith hall I finally had to cry to let him go away while explaining to him that I was broke too and wished I could help him. I feel like if I didn't get emotional, he would've kept badgering me and try to take my arm. I'm just asking that there are better patrols between these buildings during passing periods since beggars and homeless citizens know that students walk these streets between classes and most of us have cash and other valuables on us. I'm now buying mace to keep on me just in case since this area is also very vulnerable at night. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for contacting UCPD. I understand your concern and will pass this information on to security also next time this happens make sure you give security a call right away at 217-333-1212.

He was a white male, around 5'8", with short brown hair and a scruffy beard. He was wearing a black hoodie and jeans.

The user is concerned about a former Google employee, Sarah, who has been following them and their other Google ex-employee friends around the office building. They have noticed her on multiple floors and on Tuesdays, where she lives along with another of Google's ex-employees. They are worried that this behavior might intensify.


 
 User:  My friend Sarah broke up with Google two months ago, and since then she has started following us more and more (then she already did). She is in the office building very often, but she lives in New York City. We see her on all the floors, but mostly on Tuesdays, where Sarah lives along with another of Google's ex's. She always seems to be where we are when we are there, enough to make it not seem coincidental. We are worried that this behavior might intensify. Thanks. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for contacting Google Security. Would you like for us to send security so that you can make a report? 
 User: 
Not right now, thank you

 User:  This picture was taken on Main Street heading down towards City Park. The light and it's stairwell are very close to the library. There's a couple fighting on the stairway. The girl is in tears saying she will call 911 if she has to and the guy is screaming at this girl saying she won't let him explain but he's not giving her time to talk and is being verbally aggressive. I stayed and surveyed the situation to be safe and nothing physical was happening but the guy would quiet down when people were around so I had a bad feeling about it and figured I would alert you guys. Better safe than sorry. 
 Dispatcher:  This is Officer Johnson with Police Department dispatch. It is hard to tell from the picture but this is on the south side of City Park quad correct?

 User: 
Yes ma’am. Both were white - the female I couldn’t tell much about but the male looked average height, and was wearing a hat. I do not have contact with them anymore because there was enough traffic he was behaving for appearances but it seemed like a sketchy situation and felt like I should let y’all know
No I walked away to get a better view to report this and they are no longer in view.
