When I was going to pass the park St. through the narrow alley that is linked to the [ACRONYM] I stopped for a moment to check for the cars before passing, and there was a black tall woman wearing a blue jacket and black pants. Started mumbling something and looking directly to my eyes and walking towards me from the other side of the street. I just started to bike fast again and now I am safe in my apartment. I am just assuming she is maybe related to the [DATE]'s Wall St. incident. Thank you\nDispatcher: We will send officers in the area...Where did you see her last and where are you now? \n Citizen: I saw her last about ## minuets ago at [FAC] street, close to the shortcut that connects [FAC] St. to [LOC] and passes [PERSON].\nDispatcher: She walked through [FAC] towards [ORG] then \n Citizen: I[PERSON] at my own apartment right now and I[PERSON] safe\nDispatcher: Ok..Thank you...You are safe now that is good. Where do you live so we can stay in the area on our patrol \n Citizen: Just to make sure do you want to speak to an officer at all?\nDispatcher: I live on [PERSON] right across [ORG] building. Thank you so much for keeping the campus safe. \n Citizen: No thank you, I[PERSON] good and safe.\nDispatcher:"}, {"response": "You are welcome, have a good night.", "output": "Thank you for the information.

The dispatcher gives helpful and detailed guidance and instructions on how to proceed. The dispatcher is also supposed to give necessary emotional support to the citizen. \n Citizen: A man named [PERSON] has been acting suspiciously via [ORG]. I have been noticing his activity for a while now, and most of it seems to be harmless trolling and/or picking fights with people online, usually things that have to do with his far-right views. But recently he's been commenting on all the posts that have to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation on [DATE]. Anyone who posts asking for an extra ticket he responds with \u201cyes,\u201d but he is definitely not part of [ORG]Arts and I'm not sure he's even a [ORG] student. I'm a [ORG]Arts student, and I can confirm he's definitely not part of any of the departments. I've checked other posts about different graduations at [ORG] (biology, science, etc.) that are on [DATE] but he has commented on none of them, only [ORG]Arts and only responding with \u201cyes\u201d to people who ask if anyone has extra tickets. Based on his past interactions with people and his obsessive commenting on whenever anyone posts about the [ORG]Arts graduation, it has made me afraid he's planning on doing something potentially dangerous at the event. Graduation is on [DATE], and the ceremony begins at [QUANTITY]. I know it's a very vague tip but seeing him continue to comment and respond to everything that has to do with the [ORG]Arts graduation when he has nothing to do with [ORG]Arts and has been openly hostile online with [ORG]Arts students is making me really nervous. I hope that nothing is going on and he's just trolling but I felt like I needed to report it for my peace of mind just in case. Link to [ORG] profile: [WEBSITE]\nDispatcher: Thank you for providing this information. We will pass this information on to an officer. Would you like to be contacted by an officer? \n Citizen: That probably isn't necessary, that's really all the information I know. But I can also send screenshots if they're needed, I forgot to attach them beforehand.\nDispatcher: You can send the screenshots you have and I will forward them to the investigating officer. \n Citizen: Thank you! Should I do that through submitting another anonymous tip?\nDispatcher: That would be fine if you can't attach it through response here. \n Citizen: Ok it seems like I can't do it through response here so I'll do that!
