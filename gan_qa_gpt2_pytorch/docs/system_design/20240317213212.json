{"Implementation approach":"We will use PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement the GAN network. We will utilize the GPT-2 model as the discriminator and a GPT-2-based generator trained on the Squad dataset. We will modify the GPT-2 discriminator's architecture by adding classification layers for binary classification. We will print and plot the loss for both the generator and discriminator during training.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class GAN {\n        -discriminator GPT2Model\n        -generator GPT2Model\n        +train() \n        +evaluate() \n        +generate_question_answer() \n    }\n    class GPT2Model {\n        -transformer GPT2Model\n        -classifier Sequential\n        +from_pretrained(model_name: str)\n    }\n    GAN --> GPT2Model\n    GAN --> GPT2Model\n    GPT2Model --> GPT2Model\n    GPT2Model --> Sequential\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant G as GAN\n    participant D as GPT2Model (Discriminator)\n    participant GPT2 as GPT2Model (Generator)\n    G->>D: train()\n    D-->>G: loss\n    G->>GPT2: train()\n    GPT2-->>G: loss\n    G->>GPT2: generate_question_answer()\n    GPT2-->>G: question_answer_pairs\n    G->>D: evaluate()\n    D-->>G: performance_metrics\n","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
